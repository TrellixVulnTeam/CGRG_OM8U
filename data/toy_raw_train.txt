<t1> TIL 80s hair band Winger can trace their massive mid - 90s downfall in popularity to being mocked relentlessly on " Beavis and Butt-Head " and subsequent Mike Judge projects
Big grunge fan back in the day . Never heard of Winger . Just watched " Can't Get Enough " on Youtube and threw up in my mouth . Thank you Based Kurt Cobain . Praise be to Mudhoney . All Hail the Pixies .
<p> As the music scene changed in the early to mid - 1990s due to the popularity of grunge , the band faded after their third release Pull .

<p> The album coincided with the rise of grunge , which swept aside the brand of melodic pop - metal that Winger represented .

Not even that , but he thought that fruit ( i . e . little fibery sugar-bombs ) would cure his pancreatic cancer ( pancreas , i . e . the organ which breaks down sugar ) . A short question to Siri could have told him how bad of an idea that was .
<p> [ 115 ] The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is usually very poor ; [ 116 ] Jobs stated that he had a rare , much less aggressive type , known as islet cell neuroendocrine tumor .

<t1> TIL that in Japan , Hiroshima Peace Flame has been burned continuously since it was lit in 1964 , and will remain lit until all nuclear bombs on the planet are destroyed and the planet is free from the threat of nuclear annihilation
When I visited the memorial , the one thing that stuck out to me was the timeline of events . They somehow left out the events of 1941 that led to the bombing and started instead at 1945 .
<p> On August 6 , 1945 , when the bomb exploded , the roof was crushed , the interior destroyed , and everything consumable burned except in the basement .
1945
<p> on August 6 , 1945 , the explosion of the atomic bomb about 600 meters above the hypocenter destroyed the building ’ s concrete roof .

<p> The Hall of Remembrance , contains a 360 degree panorama of the destroyed Hiroshima recreated using 140,000 tiles — the number of people estimated to have died from the bomb by the end of 1945 .

<t1> TIL Seinfeld wasn't actually a " show about nothing , " it was a show about how comedians get their material . <t2> They never * really * had an episode where someone read a book to themselves for 22 minutes . That , would be a show " about nothing "
I prefer one where where the character can't pay a debt so he's sentenced to be the other character's butler .
<p> The finale poked fun at the many rumors that were circulating , seeming to move into multiple supposed plots before settling on its true storyline — a lengthy trial where the gang is prosecuted for violating a " Good Samaritan law " and sentenced to prison terms .
